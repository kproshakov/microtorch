# microtorch
## My take on the popular machine learning framework
This is my attempt at making a machine learning framework with most important features like automatic gradient computation.
Most of the API was inspired by PyTorch.

## Features:
[x] Gradient framework

[x] Support for user defined modules

[x] Linear modules

[x] Non-linear activations

[x] Optimizer framework
